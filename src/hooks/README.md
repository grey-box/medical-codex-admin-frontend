## Hooks

Author(s): Fran√ßois Pelletier

In React, hooks are like shortcuts that let you use features of React directly in your function components. They help you share and use pieces of code that manage state or other React features, without needing to restructure your components.

The hooks folder in this project has custom hooks. These are special functions we've written to do specific tasks across different components in our application. This helps us avoid repeating code.

Each hook is in its own file and has a function that does something specific. The function might need some information to work (arguments) and might give back some result (return values).

For more details on how to use each hook, check out the individual hook files.
