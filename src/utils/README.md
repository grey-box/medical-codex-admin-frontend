## Utils Directory

Author(s): Miles Murphy, Matthew Quijano

The `utils` directory contains utility functions that are used throughout the application. These functions perform various tasks such as making API requests, handling errors, and manipulating data.

Key functionalities:

- The `handleSearch` function is used to perform a search operation by making a POST request to the `/fuzzymatching/` endpoint of the API.
- The `handleTranslate` function is used to perform a translation operation by making a POST request to the `/translate/` endpoint of the API.
- Other utility functions can be added to this directory as needed.
