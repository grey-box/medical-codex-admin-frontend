The lastResort function is designed to interact with the Google Generative AI API to perform translations of medicine names into a specified target language. It uses the API key defined in the environment variables to create an instance of the Google Generative AI and leverages the generative model to produce translations.

Key Functionalities
API Key Initialization:

-The function retrieves the API key from environment variables. If the key is not defined, it throws an error to alert the user.

-It initializes a generative model using the gemini-1.5-flash model with predefined safety settings to handle potentially harmful content.

-The function constructs a prompt that asks the model to translate a given medicine name into the specified target language, while ensuring not to use brand names.

-If a valid translation is returned, it logs the result and returns the translated term. If the model does not produce valid content, it returns a fallback message indicating that no content was found.
