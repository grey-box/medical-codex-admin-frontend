## Components

Author(s): Miles Murphy, Fran√ßois Pelletier, Thayer Picart, Herman Sahani

The components located in directories outside of the 'miscellaneous' directory are actively used within the application. Each component has a specific role and functionality that contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

We follow a development pattern where each component directory serves as the component's name and includes an `index.tsx` file. This file is the single entry point for the component, making it easier to manage and import the component.

Refer to the individual component files for usage details and key functionalities.
